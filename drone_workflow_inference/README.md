# drone_workflow_inference

This folder relies on the following repositories:

* [**drone-workflow**](https://github.com/SeatizenDOI/drone-workflow)
* [**drone-inference**](https://github.com/SeatizenDOI/drone-inference)
* [**the-point-is-the-mask**](https://github.com/SeatizenDOI/the-point-is-the-mask)

The **drone-inference** module is no longer in use, as **multilabel segmentation** now provides better results than multilabel classification.

* **drone-workflow** and **drone-inference** should be run inside a **Singularity container**.
* **the-point-is-the-mask** requires a **local environment**.
